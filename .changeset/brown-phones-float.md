Introduce global note search with live filtering and cmd/ctrl+F focus,
plus ESC to clear, enabling instant navigation across large notebooks.
Implement cmd/ctrl+N to create notes and cmd/ctrl+S to save with live
status feedback, streamlining keyboard-centric workflows. Note list now
shows markdown previews and friendly timestamps for faster scanning.
Theme gains refined blue palette, new purple/gray accents, and unified
component defaults, delivering consistent dark-mode branding. Updated
docs describe the new UI and APIs. Together these changes improve
discoverability, productivity, and visual coherence.

Refresh documentation to match recent UI changes: adds detailed
explanations, usage, troubleshooting, and changelog entries for the
restructured AppShell navbar with fixed header and scrollable note list,
enhanced NoteEditor placeholders and layout, improved NoteList empty
state and scroll handling, richer NoteListItem hover/active styles with
timestamps, and newly introduced custom Mantine theme module.
